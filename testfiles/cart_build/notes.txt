About:
-------

These files are used to build an example flashcart, which we can then compare against
4 variations of prebuilt flashcarts for binary exactness.

The prebuilts were built with the arduboy toolset, which doesn't choose images properly
(as of yet). But this go toolset DOES choose at least one image in the zip file if the
proportions are correct, and we pick the first alphabetically. So, we manually picked
some images that SHOULD be automatically chosen here.

The other images are included in the folder. The arduboy files don't all have info
added to them, so they should be empty in the resulting flashcart.

Variations:
-------------

- menu patch only
- menu + dimmest contrast
- menu + ssd patch
- menu + ssd + dimmer contrast

There actually is another patch we could test, but I'm missing that feature from the
arduboy toolset, and that's the micro led patch. The one we actually care about 
is the menu patch though, so we should be fine.
