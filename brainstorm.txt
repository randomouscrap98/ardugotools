-- Command to list info about device
- PID/VID can get from go library
- Output can be in multiple formats? Maybe see how go handles serialization? Maybe only
  json for now
- The device "board type" can be retrieved using the python list (make it a dictionary?)
- Whether the bootloader is active can be pulled from the vid/pid as well. consider how to
  do this in the dictionary? Maybe a simple array of structs?
- The actual device name (Arduboy Mini/etc) can't be pulled with this stupid go library. 
  You'll need to check the bootloader
- Can return jdec info as well, for the size (maybe) and the manufacturer and stuff

- Do we return a list? Sure, each entry can list the endpoint you can find the device on
